1. ## How long did you spend on the coding test? 

    I spent almost a full day writing the test. I concentrated on writing explicit and concise code, therefore, there were debugging activities. There are risks to skip some requirements in such projects, and I need to be sure that the application works as expected. Also, it should meet the project requirements completely.

2. ## What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it

    Since I utilized React for the GoalGrid project, there exists a feature called React Hooks. They were introduced in React 16.8, allowing you to use state and other React features without possessing the class.

    In effect, for instance, the GoalGrid project used the useState and useEffect hooks to represent the task status state and handle everything else tied to it, from updating the task statuses. A small example of how these hooks could be used within the App component appears below: 

    ```javascript
    
        import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

        function App() {
            const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]); // Using useState to manage the tasks state
            const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState(''); // State for search query

            useEffect(() => {
                // Effect to update task status based on due date and time
                const updateTaskStatus = () => {
                    const now = new Date();
                    setTasks(prevTasks =>
                        prevTasks.map(task => {
                            const dueDateTime = new Date(`${task.dueDate}T${task.dueTime}`);
                            return task.status !== 'completed' && dueDateTime < now
                                ? { ...task, status: 'overdue' }
                                : task;
                        })
                    );
                };

                updateTaskStatus();
                const intervalId = setInterval(updateTaskStatus, 60000); // Update every minute

                return () => clearInterval(intervalId); // Cleanup on component unmount
            }, [tasks]); // Dependency array to run effect when tasks change

            // ... rest of the component code
        }


    ```
    
3. ## How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

    While it has not been possible for me to yet track down a performance issue in a production environment, I hold a lucid notion of the standard approaches on how diagnosis and resolution of such issues are undertaken.

    If, however, I would have to deal with a performance problem, these are the steps I would take:

    - **Monitoring and Logging**: 
    My first step would have been to ensure that substantial monitoring and logging systems are properly employed. 
    The use of APM applications to collect response time, error rates, and resource usage data would be performed. This should provide an insight into any unusual behavior identified through logging.
    - **Reproducing the Issue**: 
    Next, I would try my best to reproduce within a controlled environment. I would re-create the production load or use profiling tools to analyze performance in a similar situation.
    - **Analyzing Metrics**: 
    I would analyze the collected metrics to pinpoint the source of the performance degradation. Such metrics may include, among other things, CPU and memory analysis, database misquerying, and latency problems based on inefficiencies on the network.
    - **rofiling the Application**: 
    By running profiling tools to analyze the performance of the various components inside an application, I see that this important step would help in fixing the problems in the code, such as the use of inefficient algorithms or excessive rendering within a front-end application..


4. ## If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?

    If time allowed, I would consider adding the following features and improvements to the GoalGrid task management application:

    - **User Authentication**: Enabling user authentication will allow users to create accounts and manage their tasks securely. This opens up possibilities for personalized task management with data retention across devices.
    - **Task Prioritization and Sorting**: Improving task prioritization by enabling users to sort tasks based on due date, priority level, or status will help in focusing on more significant tasks first.
    - **Reminders and Notifications**: To implement a reminder system that sends notifications to users about forthcoming deadlines or overdue tasks. This can be done through browser notifications or emails.
    - **Task Categories and Tags**: Implementing categories or tags for tasks is a further feature that would help users better organize their tasks. They may filter or search as per these categories for a convenient management experience with related tasks.
